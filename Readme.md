#Schemer

Schemer is an experimental Ruby implementation of the Scheme programming
language as defined in the [R6RS specification](http://www.r6rs.org/). Its
goal is purely to experiment and learn from the various topics and issues
involved in developing a language interpreter.

This idea was born as a personal project developed for the [Ruby Mendicant
University](http://university.rubymendicant.com) during its Session 5.

Along with the implementation of the language itself, an interesting point of
this project is also providing an [article series](http://txus.github.com/schemer/series), a
tutorial about the paths taken and decisions made during the design,
implementation and extensions of the project. Writing this series will
hopefully serve both as a guideline for myself and for others interested in
a sometimes over-feared topic, namely programming languages.

if you want go straightforward to the [Developing a Scheme interpreter in Ruby](http://txus.github.com/schemer/series) article series page :)
